# Ask Network from first principles

Overall goal: Help people shape reality so they like it more.

## 1

A: Help
B: people
C: shape reality
D: so they like it more.

## 2

A: Provide a digital tool

B: that unlocks desired realities

C: for a social graph of all people

D: of acting so that future perceived reality is as expected

E: with each action either making desired future observations more likely or undesired future observations less likely.


## Provide a digital tool

- Node Software
- Domain Modelling Library
- User Interface
- Usage Instructions

## that unlocks desired realities

### unlocks: move into action space

(A) made theoretically possible at all && (B) reduced cost so people actuallg go for it

A: an action path that people subscribe to and serice providers commit to
B: a desirable action path

### desired: in peoples value set

### realities: a representation the user subscribes to, derived from public and private Knowledge Base

**representation:** olog scheme + instance data + observation procedures + causal-semantic domain model
**the user subscribes to:** used it to specify his asks
**derived from public and private Knowledge Base:** as of consensus state and interpreters + analyzers from domain model

## for a social graph of all people

humanity: set of all humans
user base: set of all humans who have one or more accounts in the network

## of acting so that future perceived reality is as expected

**acting so:** doing something in reality
**future perceived reality:** olog scheme + instance data + observation procedures + causal-semantic domain model, as of consensus state and interpreters + analyzers from domain model

## with each action either making desired future observations more likely or undesired future observations less likely.


A: [
- provide
- & [software, instructions]
]

B: [
]

C: [
- social network of all human beings
- who are into a causal-semantic relationship [with each other] by sharing the same actual (physical reality)
]

D: [
- acting so that = [
  - doing something in reality
  - that &[actualizes the users desires, keeps away their aversions]
   ]
- future perceived reality = $A
- is as expected = [
  - minimized surprise in future observations
  - as of domain model used to positively evaluate the executed action
   ]
]


&[
- future observations = [
  - observations
  - which are assumed to be an effect of
  - the happening that embodied the first-principle value which are represented by the users asks
  ]
- [
  - action considered
  - is [according to a causal-semantic model and latest pub + priv knowledge base] the cause (compared to inaction) of the expected desired future observations
]
- as of user defined value set, domain model
]
