# The search for economic energy

Energy is most usable when it's concetrated, and least usable when it's spread out (ref ideal heat engine YT video Veritasium).

If we see the energy in money/capital/(causal)power, what does that mean about distributing power across many people roughly evenly vs having huge wealth inequalities by concentrating capital on relatively few persons?

I gues it would boild down to many little decisions integrating information and values across the field  (spread out energy) vs having few huge decisions made by the small group of wealthy people (concentraded energy).

[alternative chain of thougt:
laws of thermodynamics:
- energy of the universe is constant (although the energy available to the economy is variable; the aggregate action space of all participants, both things and beings)
- the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum = energy tends to be spread out over time]

Few huge decisions, if done right and considering a lot of information, can have drastic impacts, as in financing huge things like a moon landing. Whereas many small decisions made uncoordinated among many people loose a lot of power.

But what they do that big txs can't is incorporating a lot more individual subjects into the economies aggregate (total) decision. And with that, a lot more diverse information, theories, and values. Combine that with a coordination mechanism between subjects to (1) find shared values and win-win, and (2) resolve conflicts ahead of time (instead of actively working against each other), and you can pool all cooperating subjects economic voting power (as in big txs) but still get diverse theories (although they need to be translated into each other to coordinate and align on how to think about the world), information (perspective of many subjects), and values (desires + aversions of many subjects, both aligning and conflicting) as in many distributed small txs.

So what you tend towards is an economy which is composed of a single huge tx that virtually budnles all buying power (=potential causal interventions of all beings and things) to enable the production of huge and highly complex products (=antropologist space), all while many diverse perspectives (information+theories) and values (desires and aversions) decide what gets produced.

[alternative next chain of thought: if inequality increases in an economy, less people have influce on the product. Once people can't afford their lifes anymore, it is even to the decrement of wealthy people since they depend on an economy that offers the production of the things they want.]

- (subjects declared wants and aversions) Deciding what to want vs
- (negotiation via automatic theories) deciding on how to get there vs [deriving a single collective strategy and with that implicitly merging all subjects values, subject to the negotiation process used]
- (acting on commitments) actually getting there

Note that having an economy composed out of a single transaction is meant in the sense of a single collective strategy. It shall not imply a single targeted value set. Indeed many value sets are targeted depending on how much influence they had in the negotiation process (the process of picking the collective strategy over all alternatives), but the target of the collective strategy then is a virtually merged value set, even though the negotiation produced a strategy and never a joint value set directly.

If we measure the amount of transactions in the economy we can see:

- (a) the amount of (purchasing) decisions being made over time; and
- (b) the relative size (=economic weight) of each decision.
- (c) representation of diverse values in economies total decision [over time]

Considering all transactions within a time window:

- Total decison = sum of the amount of all txs.
- Representation of subjects [as relative representation% assigned to each subject] = % of total decision size (in that time window) that was decided by that individual subject. -> Sum of all subject-rep% = 100%
- Representation of values [as relative representation% assigned to each distinct value] = % of all tx that realized the given value weighted by that txs size.

The total decision size essentially is the velocity of money btw. Stating how fast money has changed hands.

Further we can cluster all transactions by:

- (d) time - the ubiquitus transaction timeline
- (c) geospacial address - where the production created by this transaction took place (essentially saying where the tx took place, like in which shop you bought that water bottle, but since the tx itself is virtual without a geospacial address, the geospaial address is derived from where the causal effect created by the tx took place, which is in which shop you got handed a water bottle).
- (a) explicit participants of the transaction, which is all subjects that signed the transaction. to measure how many different values (quantified as distinct subjects perspectives and their individual desires+aversions) are integrated in active decision making (acting); boils down to defining a reward function; Usually explicit participants are:
  - payees who sink capital or work into the tx
  - benefitiaries which like the causal output (compared to inaction; and all other strategies considering the tx not being there) and receiving (capital or service)
- implicit participants (both expected [by theories ex-ante productun] and realized (by measurements ex-post production)). Those are everybody who was causally influenced by the production of the tx and would have been influenced differently if the tx would not be there.
- (b) difference in product specification (drinks vs food vs water bottle here vs water bottle there vs water bottle here in 5h). Essentially clustering transactions which are semantically close to each other in their effect close to each other.
- (d) theory usage overlap (transaction which use identical or structurally similar theories are clustered closer together)
- (c) informational context in which the decision has been made, which boils down to the geospacial address in the actual, and all practically available digital information in the virtual available to the acting paries (= everybody involved in the transaction). Clustering by deduplicated information (as defined by the causal-semantic theories used) overlap in knowledge bases across all transactions
- (e) information usage: what information was considerd in the decision that resulted in this act (the acceptance of tx for each explicit participant)

Splitting up a trading systems beavior logically into multiple independent and internally isolated strategies creates two inefficiencies: Loss of information in:

- one strategy not seing the acts of another strategy directly and without latency, only indirectly when observing an effect of that act
- one stratey does not see the decision process of another, along with missing means of communication, which makes them incapable of cooperating
- every strategy, best-effort explicitly or implicitly, has some bias towards the target outcome; different strategies having different targets is less efficient than merging the target into one by means of negotiation (align on shared values (win-wins), resolve conflicts pre-action) and then run a single strategy on that target. As opposed to every strategy maxinizing their own goal only to possibly and unconsciously negatively influencing the other strategies

To reduce infor

is
one(in 1 to 6) + one(in 1 to 6)
different to
one(int 1 to 12)
?

It is less likely to throw a sum of 2 than a sum of 6 with two dies.
But with a single dice, both the sum of 2 and 6 are equally likely.

In a sense, once we introduce time by splitting up the decision of the total value into many evenly sized decisions, we are le

An economy with a single transaction assigns the balances of all subjects to a final value once and for all. You just need one shot to be a paper-millionare forever after.

Basically, if you try once and you get the lucky 100% then you're good. Wheras if you need to get 100% multiple times in a row for an output aggregated 100%, that's way more unlikely.

Once multiple transactions between individuals happen, we get the same temporal effect as in the dice rolls. Considering each accounts total account balance over time, it would show a tendency dictated by the transaction generation mechanism.

But interrestingly, a dice roll has aversions for both 0% adn 100% as the choice of case is totally random. With a mean over an infinite amount of dice roals the sum tends to 3n, where n is the amount of dies and a mean of 3 considering a six-sided dice.

Instead of a perfectly random choice of case, lets consider a chose of case that is dictated by the economic decision of a subject with some total amount of purchasing power, and all economic offers available to him. And let's consider that there is a dice roll for each possible set of two-party transactions in the economy (money going from sender to receiver) account balance.
