# Achieving Collective Intelligence

## What is Collective Intelligence

Purposefully place meaningful signs into the environment,

for others to pick up and add to their imagination,

and possibly change their behavior because of it.

## We already are collectively intelligent

Take a traffic light as an example:ðŸš¦

We placed this thing into the environment so human drivers see it, interpret meaning into it, and adapt their behavior accordingly.

If the light is red, stop. If the light is green go.

So this meaningful traffic light practically orchestrated coordination across multiple individuals, while each individual follows their own decision process.

## We can do better

So it seems we already are collectively intelligent. But not in a digital-native manner.

This documents outlines how digital-native collective intelligence could be structured, and attempts to formalize and implement the necessary protocol to live it out.

## Goal: Enabling more humane social coordination

Designing a new mental framework to do social coordination in, plus implementing the technical infrastructure that supports its usage.

The system shall allow everybody to express their world views and values in a non-discriminatory manner, while having an optimization process that does not inherently prioritize one human over another by default. Prioritization of humans over other humans must be an emerging property from human values and the current state of reality.

A key fact to deal with is that whatever social contract humans declare to enter, their decisions are never controlled directly. Social contracts only ever influence the behavior of humans indirectly, usually be modelling sanctions and incentives that are conditioned on whether people follow through with their actions as declared in the contract or not.

Furthermore, aligning on a shared virtual state may be part of the solution, but it is not the end goal. Really it is about shaping reality the way we like it, where pretty much all preceived human value is found in reality and not on some shared ledger. The bits in the network are just the means to get to a better reality.

Also, it's important to note that the system is not meant to be a replacement for existing social contracts, but rather a supplement to them. It serves as a common framework to define new and existing coordination mechanisms in, and offers an accounting infrastructure to operate organizations at a global scale.

## Approach

This document defines concepts one after another, gradually building up to both a technical and social architecture of collective intelligence.

After the architecture is defined, we further lay out the roadmap of getting humanity to actually use it as the default way of facilitating social coordination.

## Sensory-Motor Cycle

We model the sensory motor cycle in a computable ontology to create a shared canvas of reality
