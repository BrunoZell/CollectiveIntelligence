# Power Markets

Elaborate on physical constraints of power markets, especially supply/demand balancing.

Show how it is solved in current european power markers: 15-minute auctions, regelleistung, cross-border trade respecting grid capacity (xbid).

Causality as framed by Ask Network is all about action and effect. We now place electricity in that ontology. Show how power is related to termodynamics. It essentially acts as a remote lever, very similar to the internet. Except that it's not information flowing but physical power that gets produced on one side by increasing thermodynamic entropy, and is used to decrease entropy on the cosumer side of the

Our approach to reasoning about power markets: Reiterate relevant parts of trading action and effect and how our trading system is built to support all possible domains. We're already creating the relevant power maket domain. It describes the physical reality of electricity, technologies that produce and consume power, along with a representation of the actually existing power grid, and the structure of various energy exchanges.

[optional as this is requires liquid prediction markets, altough it feels a lot of risks can be hedged in prediction markets] Trading power prices: Different means of production comes with different means of resource consumption. Solar and wind is heavily dependant on weather. Coal and nuclear are dependant on resource prices. Weather can be hedged in prediciton markets. We also aim to bring cash-settled intraday power markets onchan to attract more liqudity to the market as exchanges that trade physical delivery are hard to get access to. We monetize it by bridging the order book between the physical intraday market and cash-settled onchain markets.

Trading action and effect with power grid assets as instruments. Show how balancing the grid is a control problem. Show how with increased renewables the need for smart devices that consume power off peak increases. As we can't turn up the the supply side anymore as we like. Still, there will be a need to brige power over time, be that using hydroplants, large-scale lithium-ion batteries, or other thermodynamic methods of preserving potential energy.

Mention how decentralization of the grid is essential for using 100% renewable power sources. Solar pannels and batteries will be in households, distributed throughout the power grid. Wheras power plants traditionally had been the central points of control, what emerges are many smaller points of control, one in each household, in the form of solar pannels, battery packs, and batteries in electric vehicles.
